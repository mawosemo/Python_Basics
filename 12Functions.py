#Function
# Run blocks of code when called
# They should be unitary/ small
# They can take in arguments

#Function is like a machine.
    #It can take in inputs
    #it can perform actionsa
    #it outputs a different objects.
# An argument in a function is a variable that exists only in the scope of a finction
#Syntax

#def name_function(arg1, arg2):
    #runs block of code
# Good Practices
# - functions should be unitary
# - arguments should have good names




def say_hello():
    print('hello there')

say_hello()

def full_name(f_name, l_name):# these arguments can only be used in the block of code

       full_name_var = f_name+' '+l_name
       return full_name_var

full_name('hamza' ,'danielson')*
